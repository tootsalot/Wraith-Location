Appium Settings is bundled unmodified. Its source is available at the pinned v8.0.9
tag in the repository above. The iPhone sidecar imports the pinned upstream package;
Wraith-specific transport selection and lifecycle logic live in sidecar/ios_bridge.py.
The source and build instructions for Wraith are part of this project. When publishing
binaries, accompany them with the matching source, lockfiles, build scripts, dependency
notices, and corresponding-source material required by the bundled licenses.

Map data © OpenStreetMap contributors (ODbL). Map tiles are requested from
https://tile.openstreetmap.org under its usage policy; no offline tile downloads or
prefetching are implemented. Attribution remains visible on the map.

Place search uses Photon's public demonstration API for moderate, manually submitted
requests. Photon is Apache-2.0; underlying OpenStreetMap data is ODbL. The endpoint is
configurable in Wraith's settings. A public release with significant traffic should
use an appropriately hosted Photon service. The API operator does not guarantee uptime:
https://github.com/komoot/photon#demo-server

The application does not use the public Nominatim search API.

If the user adds their own Geoapify API key, place search and dropped-pin names use
the Geoapify Geocoding API (api.geoapify.com) on explicit request: search text, or a
pin's coordinates, is sent with the user's key. Results are not cached. Wraith shows
"Powered by Geoapify" while a key is set, as the free plan requires, alongside the
OpenStreetMap attribution. Geoapify's terms apply to the user's own account:
https://www.geoapify.com/terms-and-conditions/

Road routing first uses the public Valhalla service operated by FOSSGIS
(valhalla1.openstreetmap.de) on explicit request. Valhalla is MIT-licensed; Wraith does
not bundle its server. Source: https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla
Stop coordinates, then the planned path, are sent to the service when the user plans a
route. Fair use only, no uptime guarantee; Wraith spaces requests one second apart.

If Valhalla is unavailable, routing falls back to the public OSRM demo API (car) and the
FOSSGIS OSRM bike and foot servers (routing.openstreetmap.de). OSRM is BSD-2-Clause;
Wraith does not bundle its server. Source: https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend
The service uses OpenStreetMap data (ODbL). Stop coordinates are sent to the service
when the user plans a route; playback uses the downloaded geometry locally.
Demo limits: reasonable noncommercial use, at most one request per second, no uptime guarantee.
